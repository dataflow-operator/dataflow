                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists, Equal, Lt, and Gt. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                        Lt and Gt perform numeric comparisons (requires feature gate TaintTolerationComparisonOperators).

                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
